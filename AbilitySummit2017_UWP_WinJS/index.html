    <!-- Any data presented visually in a table must also be represented
         programmatically though UIA as being contained in table. -->

    <!-- Give the table a useful accessible name. If a visual label was available, 
         that could be defined as being the label for the table, but there is no such
         visual label in this example. So use aria-label to set the accessible name. -->

            <!-- FIX SORT ACCESSIBILITY:
              Expose information about a column being the current sort column, through the UIA FullDescription property. 
              If a visual label was available for the source of the sort order description string, then that would be 
              referenced as the source of the description, using aria-describedby. There is no such visual label in this 
              example, so create a hidden label, and reference that using aria-describedby. Note that traditionally a 
              hidden element could not be referenced in this way, but in recent versions of Edge, a hidden label can be 
              set as the accessible description for another element. -->

                <!-- FIX SORT ACCESSIBILITY:
                  Use buttons as the means through which the customer will change the sort order.
                  Buttons are keyboard accessible by default. (Note: Simply adding a role of
                  "button" to a div will not make the div keyboard accessible.) Style the buttons
                  visually if required. -->
